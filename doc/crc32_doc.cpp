  \subsection sub_crc32_configurable CONFIG_LEPTO_CRC32_CONFIGURABLE
  Provide functions to change the CRC32 implementation at runtime.
  This may cost a lot of binary space but may be interesting for host tools.
  Some STM32 only support MPEG in hardware but the host tool may support
  different controllers.
